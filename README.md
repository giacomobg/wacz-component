## Svelte project compiled with Vite

Working in Svelte:

- Make sure node is installed  
- Navigate to the root directory in terminal  
- Run `pnpm install`  
- For development, run `pnpm run dev`  
- Open up the webpage at the link it gives you, something like `localhost:5173`, and every time you save a file, it will automatically recompile and reload the webpage.  
- To get the output, run `pnpm run build` and everything you need can be found in `dist/`.
